# The Guild Attestation Intelligent Agent (AI Agent)
*This is an EthOnline 2025 Hackathon projet*

## Project Presentation

We want to create an AI Agent to help The Guild explore, manage and create on-chain attestations.

See [The Guild](theguild.dev) for more information about The Guild, a peerâ€‘run organization for software developers.

### Problem Statement
The goal of this Agent is to solve two problems The Guild has:
- Explore, navigate attestatios ([EAS](https://attest.org)): There are so many kind of attestations and they are hard to navigate. The Guild itself creates attestations for its users but an Agent could help organize them better.
- Create badges for Guild contributors. We currently have a lot of contributor activity and it is hard to keep u and more importantly assess contribution work and give appropriate badges for it.

### Solution
We build an AI Agent (RAG, Agentic System) that uses attestation history and also possibly relevant github history to solve these problems.
Considering having the Agent write a newslatter about attestations too.

### Sponsor tracks
- Envio: to fetch massive amounts of attestation data
- ASI: to decentralize the AI stack

## Project Progress

### What we are reusing
This is a fork from an ai-bootcamp repository that includes a RAG example to navigate Amazon products.
It included:
- jupyter notebooks to explore and work on data
- steamlit front end to send questions to the RAG
- fastapi backend to handle rag requests
- qdrant and langsmith setup

### Additions

#### Attestation Data Mining
- Use HyperSync to fetch EAS Attest events
- Use EAS GraphQL to enrich this data with attestation data field
- Analyze attestations to look for patterns such as github links

TODO:
- [ ] Build an attestation dataset
- [ ] Build a "Best OSS Github repo code" dataset
- [ ] Build a RAG that would help navigate attestations
- [ ] Integrate github data into the RAG
- [ ] Agentic: fetch contributor code
- [ ] Agentic: decide to emit attestations for this code
- [ ] Solidity: build badge pointers

Idea for the Hackathon:
Hackathon explorer:
Arbitrum
1735 quadratic attestations onchain: the votes for different projects
1556 attestations onchain "DEVFOLIO ONCHAIN CREDENTIALS ATTESTATIONS": You participated in hackathon X
- devfolio dataset of quadratic voting and attestations
- rag helps explore what has already been done and what was successful too
- we could have
